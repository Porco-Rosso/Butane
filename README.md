**Notes:**
- Based on Alashow's awesome original design: [https://github.com/alashow/music](https://github.com/alashow/music)


- The database being searched is [vk.com](https://vk.com)'s huge array of user-uploaded material. That being said, quality varies, but is usually great, especially for obscure content. ~ 320kbs or **at least** better than *Youtube* rips!


- Some features (for instance the playlist export/import features) only run properly if you are hosting the page from a webserver. (as opposed from just opening the .html file from your filesystem)


- Captchas are sometimes required to be entered, there is nothing I can do about this (*sorry*)


- There are no ads, and the code is all opensource (obviously)
